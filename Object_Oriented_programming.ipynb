    "# OOP Pillar: Inheritance\n",
    "When we hear the word “inheritance”, code may not be the first thing that springs to mind; we’re probably more likely to think of inheriting genetic traits, like the eye color from a mother or dimples from a grandfather. In the world of Object-Oriented Programming, inheritance is actually one of the core pillars for creating intricate structures with our classes. To dive into this concept, let’s examine a Dog and Cat class:\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog:\n",
    " \n",
    "  def bark(self):\n",
    "    print('Woof!')\n",
    " \n",
    "class Cat:\n",
    " \n",
    "  def meow(self):\n",
    "    print('Meow!')\n",
    "These two classes define two distinct animals with their own methods of communication. Now, what if we wanted to give both of these classes the ability to eat by calling a method called eat(). We could write the method twice in both classes but then we would be repeating code! We also may need to write it inside every specific animal class we ever create. Instead, we can utilize the power of inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since both Cat and Dog fall under the classification of Animal we can create a parent class to represent properties and methods they can both share! Here is what it might look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "class Animal: \n",
    "  def eat(self): \n",
    "    print(\"Nom Nom Nom...eating food!\")\n",
    "Great, we have an Animal class with a eat() method, but how do we actually get the Dog and Cat class to inherit this method so it can be shared with both classes? Well here is what the base structure will look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "class ParentClass:\n",
    "  #class methods/properties...\n",
    " \n",
    "class ChildClass(ParentClass):\n",
    "  #class methods/properties...\n",
    "If we apply this structure to our example, our code looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "  def bark(self):\n",
    "    print('Bark!')\n",
    " \n",
    "class Cat(Animal):\n",
    "  def meow(self):\n",
    "    print('Meow!')\n",
    "Now, let’s see inheritance in action:\n",

    "zoomie = Cat()\n",
    " \n",
    "fluffy.eat() # Nom Nom Nom...eating food!\n",

    "# Assignment #1 Using Inheritance in OOP\n",
    "Assignment on multiple inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem\n",
    "You have been asked to create a program for a car dealership to keep track of their inventory. The dealership sells both new and used cars.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a class hierarchy as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "A Car class with the following attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "year: an integer representing the year the car was made.\n",
    "make: a string representing the make of the car (e.g. \"Toyota\").\n",
    "model: a string representing the model of the car (e.g. \"Corolla\").\n",
    "A NewCar class that inherits from Car and has the following additional attribute:\n",
    "\n",
    "price: a float representing the price of the new car.\n",
    "A UsedCar class that inherits from Car and has the following additional attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "mileage: an integer representing the number of miles on the used car.\n",
    "price: a float representing the price of the used car.\n",
    "Your program should be able to create instances of each of these classes, and should be able to print out a description of the car, including its year, make, model, and price.\n",
    "\n",
    "Requirements\n",
    "Create the Car, NewCar, and UsedCar classes as described above.\n",
    "In the Car class, create a method called description that returns a string describing the car, including its year, make, and model.\n",
    "In the NewCar and UsedCar classes, override the description method to include the price of the car in the description.\n",
    "Create a main function that creates a few instances of each type of car, and prints out their descriptions.\n",
    "Example Output\n",
    "Here is an example of what the output of your program should look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "2018 Toyota Corolla - $20,000.00\n",
    "2012 Honda Civic - 70,000 miles - $12,000.00\n",
    "Constraints\n",
    "Your solution should use inheritance.\n",
    "The description method should return a string in the format \"YEAR MAKE MODEL - PRICE\" for new cars, and \"YEAR MAKE MODEL - MILEAGE miles - PRICE\" for used cars.\n",
    "Submission\n",
    "To submit your solution, create a file called car_dealership.py and include the classes and main function in that file."
